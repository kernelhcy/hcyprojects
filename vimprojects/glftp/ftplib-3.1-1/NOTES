Some people have complained about how paths specified to qftp end up
getting transferred to the remote system.  In other words, if I try to
send a file that is not in my current directory, I have to specify the
full path of the file as input.  The full path then gets sent to the
remote system as the desired name.

This is not a bug in ftplib.  This is the desired behavior of qftp.  I
originally wrote ftplib and qftp to copy my web site from my home linux
machine to my ISP.  I use the following command to accomplish this:

	find public_html -print | ftpsend my.isp.net -l pfau

find spits out full (relative) paths.  I need these sent as destination
names at the remote end so that the files end up in the proper
directories.

Since this is not always desirable, I suppose there should be a mode in
qftp to strip off just the file name and use that as the destination.
Alternatively, another command line switch to override the destination
file name could be specified.
